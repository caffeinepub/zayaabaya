REQ-10 (ensuring correct static asset paths for cPanel/public_html hosting) is not evidenced in the provided diff summary. The diff summary also indicates substantial marketing/UI/content changes that were not requested as part of export packaging.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the static build output uses correct relative/absolute asset paths so that it works when hosted from a typical cPanel public_html root (no broken links to CSS/JS/images).",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any changes to build configuration (e.g., Vite/React base path/public path settings) or routing/asset-path handling that would ensure built assets resolve correctly from a cPanel public_html root. Only packaging (zipping) and documentation are clearly evidenced.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on export/packaging (EXPORT.md, npm scripts, and static build asset-path correctness) and explicitly notes not to change existing marketing content/branding unless required to fix the static build output. The diff summary indicates many marketing content and styling updates without evidence they were required for static build path correctness.",
